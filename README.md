# Ubuntu Setup Instructions
While the final project will likely use a Raspberry Pi to setup up computation and screaming, it can often be more convenient to use a machine with Ubuntu for software and testing. To set up this framework, first install [Flatcam 8.2](https://bitbucket.org/jpcgt/flatcam/downloads/) from source - download the folder for Ubuntu, unzip it, and run the setup_ubuntu bash script. This will install a variety of necessary dependencies.
