# Documentation Website and Artifacts.

This directory contains all of the documentation associated with the course website for this project. While the software and firmware repositories
contain detailed documentation as well, this site is a more outward facing detail of work completed, project process and progress,
and information regarding the final deliverable.

The site is accessible [here](https://anushadatar.github.io/pcb_printer/) : [https://anushadatar.github.io/pcb_printer/](https://anushadatar.github.io/pcb_printer/). 

## Contributing
This website is made up of HTML, CSS, and JS files. To edit content, you'll want to find the appropriate HTML page, add the appropriate 
formatting, ensure that the final product matches your anticipated style guidelines, and move on. You can also just create your content in 
a pull request and I can take a look at adding it.

A tool like [this one](https://html-online.com/editor/) should make the formatting fairly straightforward for words. Unless you want to 
deviate from the overall webpage style that is enforced, I would not really recommend touching the CSS/JS portions of this tool, but it'll
make tagging and formatting easier. Feel free to create a dev branch if you're unsure, or put something in the commit message
if you think your commit will be unstable.
