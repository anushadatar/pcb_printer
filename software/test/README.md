Copy the script of interest and the gbr files you want to use to the /flatcam directory where the actual flatcam geometry lives.

Then, run `python FlatCAM.py --shellfile=[fileName]`. If the script contains a .gbr file, include that as well. Pathing can happen to this file, but it's usually more straightforward to just copy values.
